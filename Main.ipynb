    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Tracing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs every step of your LLM application (e.g., prompts, responses, tool calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps you understand how your application behaves at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Debugging**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect inputs and outputs at each step of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify where things went wrong (e.g., unexpected LLM responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Monitoring**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Track performance metrics like latency, success rates, and error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor how your application performs over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Testing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Run automated tests on your LLM chains to ensure they behave as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare different versions of your chains to see which performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Collaboration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Share traces with team members for collaborative debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotate and comment on specific runs.\n"

    "How LangSmith Works\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "0) **is it working only with agentic Ai ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith is not specifically limited to agentic AI—it’s a general-purpose tool for monitoring, debugging, and testing any LLM-powered application, including agentic AI systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Integration** :\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith integrates with LangChain applications via the langsmith Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "You enable tracing by setting the LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 environment variable to \"true\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Tracing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When tracing is enabled, LangSmith automatically logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs: The data sent to your LLM or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs: The responses from your LLM or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata: Additional context (e.g., timestamps, session IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Dashboard**:\n",
    "\n",
    "All traces are sent to the LangSmith dashboard, where you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "View detailed logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter and search traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Testing** :\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create test datasets and run automated tests on your chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith compares the actual outputs with expected outputs.\n",

    "LangSmith Code Steps\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import LangSmith Client**\n",
    "\n",
    "from langsmith import Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The Client class is used to interact with LangSmith’s API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Environment Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ.setdefault(\"LANGCHAIN_PROJECT\", \"Gmail Assistant Workflow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize LangSmith Client**\n",
    "\n",
    "client = Client()\n",
    "Initializes the LangSmith client.\n",
    "This step is optional if you’re only using automatic tracing. It’s required if you want to manually log traces or interact with the LangSmith API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automatic Tracing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once tracing is enabled, LangSmith automatically logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every call to your LLM (e.g., Ollama in your code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every tool invocation (e.g., GmailSearch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every chain execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt sent to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response generated by the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata like timestamps and session IDs.\n",
